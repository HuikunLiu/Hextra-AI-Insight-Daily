*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to here as "the Site" or "we")! Before you dive into using our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. Your access or use of the Site means you agree to and accept these terms.

## 1. Service Introduction 👋
The Site provides users with paid subscription content and membership services. These cool offerings include, but aren't limited to, blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and community interactions. Heads up, some content is only accessible to our awesome subscribers.

## 2. User Registration and Accounts 🔐
- Users need to register an account by providing a valid email address and setting up a password.
- Users are responsible for their account's security and all activities under it. Absolutely **no** transferring or sharing accounts, okay?
- The Site reserves the right to **suspend or terminate** a user's account if they violate these terms.

## 3. Paid Subscription Services 💳
- Subscription services are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with costs clearly laid out on the checkout page.
- All payments are processed through third-party payment platforms (like Stripe and PayPal). We don't store your payment information, so you're safe there!
- Subscriptions will automatically renew unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends.
- Our **14-day refund policy** means that first-time subscribers who aren't happy with the service can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us why you're unhappy. Each user gets one shot at a refund. If it's past 14 days or you're not a first-time subscriber, payments are **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property 📝
- All original content is copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday). No copying, reprinting, or commercial use without our explicit permission!
- Users only get non-exclusive, non-transferable access rights for personal learning and reading.
- For commercial use or extensive citation, please reach out to the Site to get authorization.

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines 🚫
- Users are strictly prohibited from uploading, posting, or spreading any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on others' rights.
- Also forbidden is using technical means to bulk download, scrape, or crack member content.
- The Site has the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban violating users**.

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions ⚠️
- We reserve the right to change, suspend, or terminate part or all of our services at any time, without prior notice.
- The Site will not be liable for compensation if content is temporarily unavailable due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions.

## 7. Disclaimer 🛑
- The information provided by the Site is for reference only and **does not constitute** any professional advice (like financial, legal, or medical).
- The Site is not responsible for any direct or indirect losses users incur from using the Site's content or services.

## 8. Governing Law ⚖️
